### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

- I feel like the topics that were discussed and taught in the lab prepared me to complete the assignment. It was very beneficial to look back on to see features that might have been similar in the project that were shown
  and demonstrated in the labs. The features i thought i was unprepared for were the modal and the strecth features. (Although i know that is the point of the strecth features).

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

- If i had more time, i would have structrued my code differently in order to be more organized. I now know to look at all the requirments and features to get a bigger understanding of how i want to do the wireframe,
  as i had to go back mutiple times and change the structure. I wanted to add additional features in which you could see previous "listened" playlists. I also wanted to figure out a way to be able to keep the state of the
  page so that when it reloads what you did previously, like the like button and deleted playlists, were still deleted or liked when you moved from page to page or reloaded.
  

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

- I really loved my project demo. By the time i had all the features to work flawlessly. I was able to explain my strategies as i approached the problem as well as hardships and bugs i encountered along the way.
  I then went into detail about actions i took to debug and research ideas. I noticed a lot of unique ideas from my peers that i liked. For example, the css of many of my peers were different and each had a unique thing that i would love to implement myself.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

- I want to give a shout out to Bryan, Boris, Dom, and David who are fellow peers who helped me out a lot though this project. I also want to give thanks to Mikala, an instructor, who helped me as well.
